# Book Read Site  
This is a website for users to log in and view covers of books they have read.  
Users can view each otherâ€™s pages sign-up and make a page to be able to search through book covers by author title or both.  
This is a classic node project so if you want to use it you will need to change the MySQL usernam and password to your's.  
The code used to create the Data-Base is in the file DB_Setup_code.txt.
